## User Responsibilities

### Acceptable Use Policy

Users agree to use the Bot exclusively for its intended functionalities, which include but are not limited to server management, user verification, and external API integration. Any deviation from these intended purposes constitutes a breach of these TOS and may result in the immediate termination of the User’s access to the Bot.

### Prohibited Conduct

Users are expressly prohibited from engaging in any of the following activities while using the Bot:
1. Violating any applicable local, state, national, or international laws or regulations.
2. Infringing upon the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or any other rights of third parties.

4. Utilizing the Bot to disseminate any form of spam, malware, or other malicious content.
5. Attempting to gain unauthorized access to the Bot’s systems or data, or those of its users.

## Bot Permissions

### Required Permissions

The Bot requires certain permissions to function effectively within a Server. Specifically, the Bot must be granted administrative permissions, which include but are not limited to the ability to manage roles, send messages, and perform various administrative actions. Additionally, the User must ensure that the Bot's role is positioned hierarchically above the roles of the Users it is intended to interact with, in accordance with the restrictions imposed by the Discord API.

## Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability

### Disclaimer of Warranties

The Bot is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without any representations or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. The Owner expressly disclaims all warranties, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The Owner does not warrant that the Bot will meet the User's requirements, operate in an uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free manner, or be free from viruses or other harmful components.

### Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Owner be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:

## Modifications to the Terms of Service

The Owner reserves the right to modify, amend, or revise these TOS at any time, in its sole discretion. Any changes to the TOS will be communicated to the User through a message sent to the system channel of each Server where the Bot is installed. It is the User's responsibility to review the TOS periodically for any updates or changes. Continued use of the Bot following the posting of changes constitutes acceptance of those changes.

## Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These TOS shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Owner resides, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising out of or relating to these TOS or the use of the Bot shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The User agrees to waive any right to a jury trial or to participate in a class action lawsuit.

## Severability

If any provision of these TOS is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be deemed severable from the remainder of these TOS and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

## Entire Agreement

These TOS constitute the entire agreement between the User and the Owner regarding the use of the Bot and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Bot.
