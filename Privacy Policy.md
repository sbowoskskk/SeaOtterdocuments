# Privacy Policy for Sea Otter Discord Bot

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") outlines the practices and procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by the Sea Otter Discord Bot (the "Bot") operated by its owner (the "Owner"). By accessing or using the Bot, you (the "User") consent to the data practices described in this Policy. This Policy is designed to comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations and applies to all information collected through the Bot.

## Information Collection

### Types of Information Collected

The Bot collects the following types of information:

1. **Guild Information**: Including but not limited to the guild name, guild ID, and other relevant server-specific data.
2. **User Information**: Specifically, user identification data (UID) for Users who fail to verify, to facilitate manual name matching in an external database to which the Bot does not have direct access.

### Methods of Collection

Information is collected through the following methods:

1. **Automatic Collection**: The Bot automatically collects certain information about the User's server and activities within the server as part of its operational processes.
2. **Manual Collection**: In cases where verification fails, the Owner manually collects user identification data to perform name matching.

## Use of Information

### Purpose of Data Collection

The collected information is used for the following purposes:

1. **Operational Enhancement**: Guild data is utilized for statistical analysis and to improve the functionalities and performance of the Bot.
2. **Verification Processes**: User identification data is used exclusively for manual name matching to facilitate verification processes.

### Data Retention

The Bot retains collected data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. The Owner will delete or anonymize data when it is no longer needed.

## Data Access and Security

### Data Access

Access to the collected data is strictly limited to the Owner. The Owner ensures that access to this data is restricted to authorized personnel who need it to perform their job functions and are bound by confidentiality obligations.

### Security Measures

The Owner implements appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures include, but are not limited to, encryption, access controls, and regular security assessments. However, the User acknowledges that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and therefore the Owner cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

### Third-Party Disclosure

The Owner does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties the User's personally identifiable information. The Bot does not have access to third-party databases for verification purposes. User information collected for manual name matching is used solely by the Owner and is not shared with any third parties.

### Legal Requirements

The Owner may disclose the User's information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
1. Comply with a legal obligation.
2. Protect and defend the rights or property of the Owner.
3. Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Bot.
4. Protect the personal safety of Users or the public.
5. Protect against legal liability.

## User Rights

### Access and Correction

Users have the right to request access to the personal information that the Bot holds about them and to request correction of any inaccurate or incomplete information. Users may exercise these rights by contacting the Owner through the contact information provided in the Bot's description.

### Deletion and Objection

Users have the right to request the deletion of their personal information or to object to the processing of their personal information. Such requests will be honored unless the information is required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

The Owner reserves the right to modify or update this Policy at any time, in its sole discretion. Any changes to this Policy will be communicated to the User through a message sent to the system channel of each Server where the Bot is active. It is the User's responsibility to review this Policy periodically for any updates or changes. Continued use of the Bot following the posting of changes constitutes acceptance of those changes.

## Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Owner resides, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising out of or relating to this Policy or the use of the Bot shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The User agrees to waive any right to a jury trial or to participate in a class action lawsuit.
